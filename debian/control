Description: converts DICOM and PAR/REC files into the NIfTI format
 This is the successor of the well-known dcm2nii program. it aims to provide
 same functionality albeit with much faster operation.
 This is a new tool that is not yet well tested, and does not handle ancient
 proprietary formats. Use with care.
